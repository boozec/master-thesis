\section{Tests Environment}

The previous section described how the system has been implemented to test every
component following a flow, from the uplodas by an user to the corruption check
from the leader agent in the Raft cluster.

In this new section the reader will read how the tests environment was
setted up with different scenarios, and later will be aware about the obtained
results.
